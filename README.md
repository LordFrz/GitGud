- Added support for Muzzle Boost for a few weapons, adding the rest later.
- Added Hanzo (overwatch?) reticle
- Reworked the Burst System. No need to set it or even activate it anymore.

- Crosshair Images look for 0,0 as the transparency color.
- Cleaned up some of the messy code for people who like to inspect or change the code.
- Works through Devblog 163.
