An FPS Autohotkey system specific for Rust

While this will contains features that can be used for many FPS games, it is designed specifically for Rust.

_Does **NOT** work if you don't play in FullScreen or Windowed Full Screen._

### _Features_

**Weapon Recoil Reduction**
- Semi-Auto Rifle
- AK
- Python
- Thompson
- MP5A4
- Semi-Auto Pistol
- LR300
- M249
- M92
- SMG



**Attachment**
- Simple Sight
- Holosight
- 4x Scope
- Boost



**Screen Centered Reticle System**
- _Color Slider_
- _Reticle On/Off Toggle_
- Sniper Lines
- Range Distance Lines
- Holo Sight
- Cross
- Dot
- V Sight
- Gap Dash
- X Sight
- Quad Dot
- Hanzo
- ???

_If you want to make a custom reticle, just create an image and replace one of the current reticle in the Images folder. The Reticle you create need to have a transparent background. And the Pixles at 0,0 (Top Left) must be that same transparent color._



**Customizable Hotkeys**
- Recoil Reduction On/Off Toggle
- Minimize/Maximize Toggle
- Suicide Command
- Consecutive Fire Mode Toggle
- _4 quick chat commands_


**Burst Mode**
Burst mode is a pasive system in place that turns all semi auto weapons into fully automatic just by holding the fire button.

**Consecutive Fire Mode**
Currently only supports the AK. From the Config tab, set the time between shots in MS. This will make the AK fire fast consecutive single click shots. This is to counter the Aimcone.

**Supports any sensitivity**

While defaults are optimized for Rust in-game sensitivity of 1, you may set your preferred sensitivity in the GUI and all values will be adjusted accordingly.

### //////////////////////////////PATCH 1.6.7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
6-10-17
- Added support for Muzzle Boost for a few weapons, adding the rest later.
- Added Hanzo (overwatch?) reticle
- Reworked the Burst System. No need to set it or even activate it anymore.
- Selecting a semi-auto weapon makes it fully automatic when the mouse is held down. For example, select M92, aim at your friend and hold down the mouse button
- Cleaned up some of the messy code for people who like to inspect or change the code.
- Works through Devblog 163.
### //////////////////////////////PATCH 1.6.7\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
6-12-17
- Lots of minor bug fixes
- Added AK Consecutive Fire mode. Just select time between shots in Config, and set hotkey for toggle in settings.
- Script now disabled while mouse is not at center of the screen. This allows for inventory managment or minamized use while script still enabled.
